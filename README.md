# HomelessLA
-This is a shiny app visualizing nearly a decade of homeless data from LAHSA
  -The app allows you to look at the distributions of different characteristics of a number of different subpopulations of 
  the LA homeless population to better understand the living situations of LA's homeless population
  
  
-Shiny apps allow R users to build interactive web apps by wrapping html and css in R functions
-There are four components:
  -Global: This is where you define your global environment
  -UI: This is where you build the user interface that collects user input
  -Server: This is where you take the user input and make responsive R output 
  -Data: This is the data the the app runs off of
  
-You must save all of these into a single folder and name each component global.r, ui.r, and server.r for the app to run successfully
